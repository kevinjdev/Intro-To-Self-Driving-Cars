## Histogram Filter in Python2
For this project I implemented the 2D **sense** function in *localize.py* to update a robot's belief in its current position to perform localization. I also used pdb to debug the **move** function, fixing a bug due  to incorrect array indexing.

### Prerequisites
* Jupyter Notebook installed
* Python 2 environment active. Using Anaconda, I ran the following 2 commands in terminal to set up a python2 environment in Jupyter
```
conda install nb_conda_kernels
conda create -n py27 python=2.7 ipykernel
```

### How To Run
Start Jupyter, then open the notebook file **writeup.ipynb** located in the **Histogram Filter in Python2** folder`
